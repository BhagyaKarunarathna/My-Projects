# Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin closing prices using various deep learning models, including LSTM, LSTM with hyperparameter tuning, Transformer, and CNN models. The analysis begins with preprocessing and feature engineering on a Bitcoin dataset, followed by model development to identify patterns in historical data.
