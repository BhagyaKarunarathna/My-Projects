The project comprises two interconnected dashboards designed to provide insights into critical global issues. The Global Terrorism Dashboard visualizes and analyzes terrorism data worldwide, offering trends, hotspots, and key statistics to enhance understanding and inform policy decisions.

The Global Black Money Transactions Dashboard focuses on tracking illicit financial flows, highlighting patterns and anomalies in global black money transactions.
