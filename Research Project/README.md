# Development of Deep Learning Framework for Forecasting Solar PV Power Levels based on Cloud Motions

The project aims to enhance solar energy generation predictions through a novel Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model. This framework captures both spatial and temporal dependencies in cloud cover data, allowing for accurate predictions of solar photovoltaic (PV) system performance. 

Through a carefully designed architecture that includes multiple ConvLSTM2D layers and regularization techniques such as Batch Normalization and Dropout, the model effectively learns complex patterns in cloud dynamics. Following evaluation, the binary classification model demonstrated the highest accuracy among the tested models, leading to its selection for further development. Hyperparameter tuning revealed that random search provided the best model performance compared to Bayesian optimization, optimizing key parameters such as filter sizes, kernel dimensions, and learning rates. The findings from this research promise significant advancements in predicting solar PV power levels, ultimately contributing to more efficient solar energy utilization in variable weather conditions.
